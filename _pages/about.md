Hi, I’m Mark Herndon—a third-year Data Science and Statistics student at UT Austin, graduating in May 2027. I’m interested in roles where I can contribute data-driven solutions grounded in statistical reasoning, inference, and data modeling—paired with clear communication, so insights aren’t just accurate but actionable.

I’ve come to appreciate that in statistics, nature often provides a fixed data distribution. Where the mission of the data scientist is to recover its structure—despite noise, gaps, or bias—to enable informed decisions under uncertainty.

Outside the classroom, I’ve volunteered as a math and science tutor, built personal research projects using scraped datasets, and interned at a seafood distribution company, where I analyzed sales trends to inform inventory strategy.



Experience & Projects
======

I currently have an Independent Reproducibility Project that focuses on an analysis on experimental data design and data distribution methods. I also have a project on prediciting housing rices in Saratoga County, NY using machine learning methods with linear regresiion models. As well as data analysis and visualization projects on global emissions and World IQ and the external factors that effect them, along with other Data Science projects I have done throughout the academic year in R and Python. 

I have also interned at Gulf King Seafood, a seafood distribution business based in Corpus Chisti, TX. There, I analyzed sales data across product categories to support inventory and pricing decisions. I identified seasonal trends that helped inform restocking schedules and optimize product inventory levels.
